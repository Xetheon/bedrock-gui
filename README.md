> A gui style for menus based on Bedrock Edition

## About

- [Capes](https://modrinth.com/mod/capes)
- [Malilib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib)
- [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica)

This pack also supports [Respackups!](https://modrinth.com/mod/respackopts) If you have the mod installed, you'll be able to disabled certain features or even try out alternate styles!
